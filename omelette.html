    <p class="intro">The egg is one of the most protein rich foods. Today, we will show you how to prepare a very simple omelette dish. We hope the outcome will be savory and worth the effort.</p>


    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 slices bacon</li>
<li>1 teaspoon water</li>
<li>cooking spray</li>
<li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
<li>Â½ white onion, diced</li>
        <li>cooking oil</li>
        <li>2 medium sized red onions</li>
        <li>2 short green onions</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons coriander</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
    </ul>
<h2>How to make the omelette</h2>
<ol>
    <li> Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Arrange bacon on a baking sheet.</li>

<li> Bake in the preheated oven until just crisped, 10 to 12 minutes.</li>

<li> Beat eggs and water together in a bowl.</li>

<li> Let the bacon cool on paper towels, about 5 minutes. Break into small pieces.</li>

<li> Spray a 10-inch non-stick skillet with cooking spray. Melt butter over medium heat until foaming, about 2 minutes. Add onion once butter is no longer foaming. Cook and stir until tender but not browned, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>

<li> Increase heat to medium-high. Pour eggs into the skillet and cook until mostly set, about 2 minutes. Lift the omelet with a spatula as the center rises; tilt the skillet so that uncooked eggs run to the center of the pan. Cook until set, 2 to 4 minutes. Sprinkle bacon pieces onto the omelet and fold in half using the spatula.</li> 
</ol>
